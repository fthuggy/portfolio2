          <p>
            Hello! My name is Fatou.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>I’m a Frontend Developer student at Hyper Island with a
            strong passion for design and creating user-friendly websites. My
            current skill set includes <strong>HTML</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>CSS</strong>,<strong>JavaScript</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>React</strong>, and I’m actively expanding my knowledge in{" "}
            <strong>UI/UX design</strong> and other frameworks.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills to
            stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>
              Right now, I’m looking for an internship opportunity
            </strong>{" "}
            where I can apply my skills, gain hands-on experience, and continue
            learning whether it’s deepening my expertise in frontend development
            or exploring new frameworks.
            <br />
            <br />I thrive in both independent and team environments. I can take
            the lead when needed, but I’m equally comfortable collaborating and
            contributing as part of a team.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a background in <strong>communication</strong> and <strong>project management</strong>, I’ve developed strong
            collaboration and leadership skills that have been invaluable in
            team projects during my studies. My experience also helps me think
            strategically about design, content, and user experience, ensuring
            that the websites I build are not only functional but also engaging
            and goal-oriented.
            <br />
            <br />
            Take a look at my projects, and feel free to reach out!
